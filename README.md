# About

I took a course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-markdown) to learn how to write markdown files and I am dedicating this repo to add my lessons about markup.


I took a second course on [Udemy](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/markdown) to learn more about markdown and I added more notes from my learning.
